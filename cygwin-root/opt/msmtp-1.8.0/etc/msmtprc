# Set a list of trusted CAs for TLS. You can use a system-wide default file,
# as in this example, or download the root certificate of your CA and use that.
# This is Cygwin-based setting. 
# If this file does not exist, You need to configure param tls_fingerprint 
# in every account setting.
# How to verify tls_trust_file param is OK? use this command:
# /opt/msmtp-1.8.0/bin/msmtp --serverinfo --tls --tls-starttls=off  --tls-trust-file=[tls_trust_file param value] --host=smtp.aaaaa.com --port=465

# As an alternative to tls_trust_file/tls_crl_file, you can use tls_fingerprint
# to pin a single certificate. You have to update the fingerprint when the
# server certificate changes, but an attacker cannot trick you into accepting
# a fraudulent certificate. Get the fingerprint with this command:
# /opt/msmtp-1.8.0/bin/msmtp --serverinfo --tls --tls-certcheck=off --tls-starttls=off --host=smtp.aaaaa.com --port=465

# Set password has some methods. This example conf file only take 2 methods:
#   - passwordeval: recommend, but need some knowledges.
#   - password: not so recommend, but it is convenient.
# Other password param Example: https://marlam.de/msmtp/msmtp.html#Examples

# Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell msmtp
# which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in
# this example. Usually gpg-agent will ask once for the decryption password.
#passwordeval gpg2 --no-tty -q -d ~/.msmtp-password.gpg

# Password method 3: Store the password directly in this file. Usually it is not
# a good idea to store passwords in plain text files. If you do it anyway, at
# least make sure that this file can only be read by yourself.
